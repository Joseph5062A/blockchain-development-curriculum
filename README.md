# Blockchain Development Curriculum 2022

This repository contains the instructor documents and student exercises that I created for an undergraduate tech-elective in collaboration with the Milwaukee School of Engineering.  

It also contains my presentation materials and technical report from when I was invited to speak at the 2022 MICS conference about core messages of the course and the outcomes of developing undergraduate curriculum.
